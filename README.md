# CS300

* **What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?** <br/>
The problem we were trying to solve was what was the best data structure and alorithm for performance in our academic advising assistance software. In this software, course information had to be ingested, stored, and sorted quickly.
* **How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.** <br/>
We approached this problem by using pseudocode to pla how we would implement different data structures in the application. Once we had our pseudocode we performed runtime analysis on the pseudocode to select which data structure would be the best for our application.
* **How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?** <br/>
Quite frankly, I did not have a lot of time to dedicate to this project so I circumvented roadblocks by skipping them entirely. For example, I skipped the binary tree in Project One and ended up using a vector as my data structure in Project Two instead of the hash table as planned. Searching would have been much faster with a hash table.
* **How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?** <br/>
This project has taught me to consider performance when developing appications. It is not enough that they run, they should also have good performance.
* **How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?** <br/>
This project taught me to stop and plan. Never before had I used pseudocode to plan my code before starting. I usually started with a general idea of what I would do and perfected it as I worked.
